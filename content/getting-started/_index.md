If you are not familiar of what we do , and what is Shieldfy , take a look at [Shieldfy](https://shieldfy.io) and [How shieldfy works](https://shieldfy.io/how-it-works.html)



Shieldfy is designed to be very simple to get off the ground, yet so flexible to adjust it to your exact needs

## Getting started with Shieldfy is a two step process:

- **Sign up for an account [here](https://cloud.shieldfy.io/register)**
- **Configure the SDK [See here]({{< ref "installation" >}})**


## Configure the SDK

Shieldfy analysis done via our SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime. These are platform specific, and allow Shieldfy to have a deep understanding of how your application works.
