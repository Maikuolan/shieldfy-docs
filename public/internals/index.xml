      <description>Exceptions within the SDK We tried to make the SDK stable as possible but anything can happens it&amp;rsquo;s the basic programming rules. Because of that we added custom exception handler to the SDK for the errors happens in the SDK code itself
So for example if there is an error occur in the SDK code, the custom handler will catch the exception and will prevent the exception from stop the application execution.</description>
